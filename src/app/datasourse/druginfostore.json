The pharmacodynamic characteristics of it most closely resemble those of benazepril, fosinopril, and quinapril, all of which are prodrugs. The active metabolite, itat, competes with angiotensin-converting enzyme for the substrate angiotensin I, blocking its conversion to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and negative-feedback mediator for renin activity. Lower levels of angiotensin II produce a drop in blood pressure and a rise in plasma renin. It also inhibits Kininase II (identical to ACE), an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, to inactive peptides, resulting in increased bradykinin levels.

As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots. Anticoagulants decrease the clotting ability of the blood and therefore help to prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m\ufffd) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m\ufffd) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m\ufffd). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Gadavist administration to Bayer Healthcare (1-888-842-2937) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch). Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing. Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Gadavist dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
